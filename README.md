## About me

I'm an IT Service Desk Manager ( +Sysadmin :grin:) within a global company group. The language I use the most is PowerShell, with which I try to automate as many corporate workflows as possible. I think almost anything can be solved with the help of a "little" PS and that's why I can say I'm pretty fanatical about the language. :grin: I often use C# and rarely Python or Lua for my own projects.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on [PoshSYSI](https://github.com/Kinsiinoo/PoshSYSI) and [PoshDirSize](https://github.com/Kinsiinoo/PoshDirSize).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Go** and **PowerShell runspace** usage (:dizzy_face:).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. universe. (:video_game: & :book:)
- :radioactive: ***"A stalker can leave the zone, but the zone will never leave a stalker!"***

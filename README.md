## About me

I'm a Sysadmin within a global company group. The language I use the most is PowerShell, with which I try to automate as many corporate workflows as possible. I think almost anything can be solved with the help of a "little" PS and that's why I can say I'm pretty fanatical about the language. :grin: I often use C# and rarely Python or Lua for my own projects.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a PowerShell system information program.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PowerShell runspace usage. :dizzy_face:
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. universe. (:video_game: & :book:)
